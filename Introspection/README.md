# INTROSPECTION

### Why must we choose you?
Since childhood I was interested in coding and designing.I wanted to learn how these webpages and applications are made. I like to develop webpages and android applications. I wanted to make my career out of it. So I started free lancing in Designing (not coding), Since 8th class I started learning photoshop and various designing applications. As there were no one to teach coding and due to some circumstances and financial troubles I didnt learn coding :-( , but I love to learn it. This is my story in brief.

Some qualities of me :
I am passionate about my work and take my work very serious. Sometimes I will lit midnight lamp to complete my work.
I will be available at any time (except if I have any emergency or very important work), no problem in working over time if required.
As I have experience in designing I can make my work in a creative and beautiful manner.
If Mentors gave the right guidance to me I may create wonderful things.
